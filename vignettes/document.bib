However, the complexity of the information to be analyzed has turned this into a challenging task. In the last few years, a plethora of tools have been developed, allowing researchers to process RNA-Seq data to study the expression of isoforms and splicing events, and their relative changes under different conditions. We provide an overview of the methods available to study splicing from short RNA-Seq data, which could serve as an entry point for users who need to decide on a suitable tool for a specific analysis. We also attempt to propose a classification of the tools according to the operations they do, to facilitate the comparison and choice of methods.},

  abstract = {Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis allows researchers to efficiently extract biological insight from long lists of differentially expressed genes by interrogating them at a systems level. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of GSE analysis methods and hence it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to select an optimal GSE tool based on their particular dataset. Moreover, the majority of GSE analysis methods do not allow researchers to simultaneously compare gene set level results between multiple experimental conditions.The ensemble of genes set enrichment analyses (EGSEA) is a method developed for RNA-sequencing data that combines results from twelve algorithms and calculates collective gene set scores to improve the biological relevance of the highest ranked gene sets. EGSEA’s gene set database contains around 25 000 gene sets from sixteen collections. It has multiple visualization capabilities that allow researchers to view gene sets at various levels of granularity. EGSEA has been tested on simulated data and on a number of human and mouse datasets and, based on biologists’ feedback, consistently outperforms the individual tools that have been combined. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the ensemble approach for GSE analysis, and its utility to effectively and efficiently extrapolate biological functions and potential involvement in disease processes from lists of differentially regulated genes.EGSEA is available as an R package at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/EGSEA/. The gene sets collections are available in the R package EGSEAdata from http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/EGSEAdata/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {X chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences most genes on one X chromosome in female mammals, but some genes escape XCI. To identify escape genes in vivo and to explore molecular mechanisms that regulate this process we analyzed the allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed XCI and distinguishable alleles based on single nucleotide polymorphisms. Using a binomial model to assess allelic expression, we demonstrate a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X (Xi). The validity of the RNA-seq approach was verified using RT-PCR with species-specific primers or Sanger sequencing. Both common escape genes and genes with significant differences in XCI status between tissues were identified. Such genes may be candiyears for tissue-specific sex differences. Overall, few genes (3–7\%) escape XCI in any of the mouse tissues examined, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro system represented by the embryonic-kidney-derived Patski cell line showed a higher density of escape genes (21\%), representing both kidney-specific escape genes and cell-line specific escape genes. Allele-specific RNA polymerase II occupancy and DNase I hypersensitivity at the promoter of genes on the Xi correlated well with levels of escape, consistent with an open chromatin structure at escape genes. Allele-specific CTCF binding on the Xi clustered at escape genes and was denser in brain compared to the Patski cell line, possibly contributing to a more compartmentalized structure of the Xi and fewer escape genes in brain compared to the cell line where larger domains of escape were observed.},

  abstract = {Objective CROP-Seq combines gene silencing using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to conduct a functional reverse genetic screen of novel gene targets associated with adipocyte differentiation or function, with single-cell transcriptomes as the readout. Methods We created a human preadipocyte SGBS cell line with stable expression of KRAB-dCas9 for CRISPRi-mediated gene knock-down. This line was transduced with a lentiviral library of sgRNAs targeting 6 genes of interest (3 sgRNAs / gene, 18 sgRNAs), 6 positive control genes (3 sgRNAs / gene, 18 sgRNAs), and non-targeting control sgRNAs (4 sgRNAs). Transduced cells were selected and differentiated, and individual cells were captured using microfluidics at day 0, 4 and 8 of adipogenic differentiation. Next, expression and sgRNA libraries were created and sequenced. Bioinformatic analysis of resulting scRNA-Seq expression data was used to determine the effects of gene knock-down and the dysregulated pathways, and to predict cellular phenotypes. Results Single-cell transcriptomes obtained from SGBS cells following CRISPRi recapitulate different states of differentiation from preadipocytes to adipocytes. We confirmed successful knock-down of targeted genes. Transcriptome-wide changes were observed for all targeted genes, with over 400 differentially expressed genes identified per gene at least at one timepoint. Knock-down of known adipogenesis regulators PPARG and CEBPB inhibited adipogenesis. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed molecular processes for adipose tissue differentiation and function for novel genes. MAFF knock-down led to a downregulation of transcriptional response to proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in preadipocytes. TIPARP knock-down resulted in an increase in the expression of a beiging marker UCP1 at D8 of adipogenesis. Conclusions The CROP-Seq system in SGBS cells can determine the consequences of target gene knock-down at the transcriptome level. This powerful, hypothesis-free tool can identify novel regulators of adipogenesis, preadipocyte and adipocyte function associated with metabolic disease.

We constructed a de novo transcriptome using long-read data, and successfully assigned 19,794 transcript isoforms in total, including clinically-relevant, but yet uncharacterized modes of transcription, such as intron retention or antisense overlapping transcription. We showed a higher transcriptome complexity in the healthy regions, and identified intron retention as a mode of transcription associated with the infarct area. Our data revealed a clear regional isoform switching among differentially used transcripts for genes involved in cardiac muscle contraction and tissue morphogenesis.

Considerable improvements have been made to the original code plus many new features including newer access protocols, the addition of the CRAM file format, better indexing and iterators, and better use of threading.Since the original Samtools release, performance has been considerably improved, with a BAM read-write loop running 5 times faster and BAM to SAM conversion 13 times faster (both using 16 threads, compared to Samtools 0.1.19). Widespread adoption has seen HTSlib downloaded \&gt;1 million times from GitHub and conda. The C library has been used directly by an estimated 900 GitHub projects and has been incorporated into Perl, Python, Rust, and R, significantly expanding the number of uses via other languages. HTSlib is open source and is freely available from htslib.org under MIT/BSD license.},

Here we present Bambu, a method that performs machine-learning-based transcript discovery to enable quantification specific to the context of interest using long-read RNA-sequencing. To identify novel transcripts, Bambu estimates the novel discovery rate, which replaces arbitrary per-sample thresholds with a single, interpretable, precision-calibrated parameter. Bambu retains the full-length and unique read counts, enabling accurate quantification in presence of inactive isoforms. Compared to existing methods for transcript discovery, Bambu achieves greater precision without sacrificing sensitivity. We show that context-aware annotations improve quantification for both novel and known transcripts. We apply Bambu to quantify isoforms from repetitive HERVH-LTR7 retrotransposons in human embryonic stem cells, demonstrating the ability for context-specific transcript expression analysis. Leveraging long-read RNA-seq data and machine learning, Bambu facilitates accurate transcript discovery and quantification.},

Over the past 15 years, edgeR has been a popular choice for statistical analysis of data from sequencing technologies such as RNA-seq or ChIP-seq. edgeR pioneered the use of the negative binomial distribution to model read count data with replicates and the use of generalized linear models to analyse complex experimental designs. edgeR implements empirical Bayes moderation methods to allow reliable inference when the number of replicates is small. This article announces edgeR version 4, which includes new developments across a range of application areas. Infrastructure improvements include support for fractional counts, implementation of model fitting in C++, and a new statistical treatment of the quasi-likelihood pipeline that improves accuracy for small counts. The revised package has new functionality for differential methylation analysis, differential transcript expression, differential transcript and exon usage, testing relative to a fold-change threshold and pathway analysis. This article reviews the statistical framework and computational implementation of edgeR, briefly summarizing all the existing features and functionalities but with special attention to new features and those that have not been described previously.},

However, existing tools, which perform these functions are often task-specific, such as only demultiplexing barcodes for a dedicated type of experiment, or are not tolerant to noise in the sequencing data.To overcome these limitations, we developed Flexiplex, a versatile and fast sequence searching and demultiplexing tool for omics data, which is based on the Levenshtein distance and thus allows imperfect matches. We demonstrate Flexiplex’s application on three use cases, identifying cell-line-specific sequences in Illumina short-read single-cell data, and discovering and demultiplexing cellular barcodes from noisy long-read single-cell RNA-seq data. We show that Flexiplex achieves an excellent balance of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to leading task-specific tools.Flexiplex is available at https://davidsongroup.github.io/flexiplex/.},

  abstract = {The human genome contains more than 200,000 gene isoforms. However, different isoforms can be highly similar, and with an average length of 1.5kb remain difficult to study with short read sequencing. To systematically evaluate the ability to study the transcriptome at a resolution of individual isoforms we profiled 5 human cell lines with short read cDNA sequencing and Nanopore long read direct RNA, amplification-free direct cDNA, PCR-cDNA sequencing. The long read protocols showed a high level of consistency, with amplification-free RNA and cDNA sequencing being most similar. While short and long reads generated comparable gene expression estimates, they differed substantially for individual isoforms. We find that increased read length improves read-to-transcript assignment, identifies interactions between alternative promoters and splicing, enables the discovery of novel transcripts from repetitive regions, facilitates the quantification of full-length fusion isoforms and enables the simultaneous profiling of m6A RNA modifications when RNA is sequenced directly. Our study demonstrates the advantage of long read RNA sequencing and provides a comprehensive resource that will enable the development and benchmarking of computational methods for profiling complex transcriptional events at isoform-level resolution.},

Recent advances in the field have made it possible to explore the transcriptomes of single cells. However, most widely used RNA-seq protocols fail to provide crucial information regarding transcription start sites. Here we present a protocol, Tn5Prime, that takes advantage of the Tn5 transposase-based Smart-seq2 protocol to create RNA-seq libraries that capture the 5′ end of transcripts. The Tn5Prime method dramatically streamlines the 5′ capture process and is both cost effective and reliable. By applying Tn5Prime to bulk RNA and single cell samples, we were able to define transcription start sites as well as quantify transcriptomes at high accuracy and reproducibility. Additionally, similar to 3′ end-based high-throughput methods like Drop-seq and 10× Genomics Chromium, the 5′ capture Tn5Prime method allows the introduction of cellular identifiers during reverse transcription, simplifying the analysis of large numbers of single cells. In contrast to 3′ end-based methods, Tn5Prime also enables the assembly of the variable 5′ ends of the antibody sequences present in single B-cell data. Therefore, Tn5Prime presents a robust tool for both basic and applied research into the adaptive immune system and beyond.}

  abstract = {Application of Oxford Nanopore Technologies' long-read sequencing platform to transcriptomic analysis is increasing in popularity. To explore how much additional benefit it brings over short-read RNA-seq, as well as provide guidance in the choice of suitable long-read RNA-seq data analysis methods, I first created a long-read RNA-seq analysis pipeline using a mix of long-read specific preprocessing tools together with established short-read methods for differential expression analysis. Using this pipeline, I analyzed two nanopore long-read RNA-seq datasets and compared the results to short-read experiments with equivalent samples. The results showed that performing differential gene expression analysis using this pipeline can yield comparable results to those obtained using short-read data. Secondly, I designed a comprehensive long-read benchmarking experiment with ground-truth provided by sequin spike-ins and an in silico mixture design. Samples were deeply sequenced using both short-read and long-read technologies. By analyzing this dataset, I found that StringTie2 and bambu outperformed other tools from the 6 isoform detection tools tested, DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom were best amongst the 5 differential transcript expression tools tested, and there was no clear front-runner for performing differential transcript usage analysis between the 5 tools compared. Finally, I used the best-in-class methods identified in the benchmark study to detect aberrant minor class RNA splicing due to the knockdown of the RNPC3 gene in A549 cell line samples. Differentially expressed and differentially used transcripts detected on the long-read RNA-seq data were highly correlated with annotated minor intron-containing genes. I also visualized the long- and short-read coverage of the five top genes with differential transcript usage, which further highlighted the strength of long-reads in detecting and visualizing transcript splicing. The datasets generated and benchmarking results presented in this thesis provide useful resources and insights for long-read RNA-seq analysis to the research community.},

Here, we present a benchmark experiment using two human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that were each profiled in triplicate together with synthetic, spliced, spike-in RNAs (“sequins”). Samples were deeply sequenced on both Illumina short-read and Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read platforms. Alongside the ground-truth available via the sequins, we created in silico mixture samples to allow performance assessment in the absence of true positives or true negatives. Our results show that, StringTie2 and bambu outperformed other tools from the 6 isoform detection tools tested, DESeq2, edgeR and limma-voom were best amongst the 5 differential transcript expression tools tested and there was no clear front-runner for performing differential transcript usage analysis between the 5 tools compared, which suggests further methods development is needed for this application.},

  abstract = {Distinguishing how genetics impact cellular processes can improve our understanding of variable risk for diseases. Although single-cell omics have provided molecular characterization of cell types and states on diverse tissue samples, their genetic ancestry and effects on cellular molecular traits are largely understudied. Here, we developed Monopogen, a computational tool enabling researchers to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from a variety of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing data. It leverages linkage disequilibrium from external reference panels to identify germline SNVs from sparse sequencing data and uses Monovar to identify novel SNVs at cluster (or cell type) levels. Monopogen can identify 100K\textasciitilde 3M germline SNVs from various single cell sequencing platforms (scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq etc), with genotyping accuracy higher than 95\%, when compared against matched whole genome sequencing data. We applied Monopogen on human retina, normal breast and Asian immune diversity atlases, showing that that derived genotypes enable accurate global and local ancestry inference and identification of admixed samples from ancestrally diverse donors. In addition, we applied Monopogen on \textasciitilde 4M cells from 65 human heart left ventricle single cell samples and identified novel variants associated with cardiomyocyte metabolic levels and epigenomic programs. In summary, Monopogen provides a novel computational framework that brings together population genetics and single cell omics to uncover genetic determinants of cellular quantitative traits.},

  abstract = {Background Spatial transcriptomics allows gene expression to be measured within complex tissue contexts. Among the array of spatial capture technologies available is 10x Genomics’ Visium platform, a popular method which enables transcriptomewide profiling of tissue sections. Visium offers a range of sample handling and library construction methods which introduces a need for benchmarking to compare data quality and assess how well the technology can recover expected tissue features and biological signatures. Results Here we present SpatialBench, a unique reference dataset generated from spleen tissue of mice responding to malaria infection spanning several tissue preparation protocols (both fresh frozen and FFPE samples, with and without CytAssist tissue placement). We noted better quality control metrics in reference samples prepared using probe-based capture methods, particularly those processed with CytAssist, validating the improvement in data quality produced with the platform. Our analysis of replicate samples extends to explore spatially variable gene detection, the outcomes of clustering and cell deconvolution using matched single-cell RNA-sequencing data and publicly available reference data to identify cell types and tissue regions expected in the spleen. Multi-sample differential expression analysis recovered known gene signatures related to biological sex or gene knockout. Conclusions We framed a comprehensive multi-sample analysis workflow that allowed us to generate consistent results both within and between different subsets of replicate samples, enabling broader comparisons and interpretations to be made at the group-level. Our SpatialBench dataset, analysis, and workflow can serve as a practical guide for Visium users and may prove valuable in other benchmarking studies.},

Spatial VDJ captures lymphocyte clones that match canonical B and T cell distributions and amplifies clonal sequences confirmed by orthogonal methods. We found spatial congruency between paired receptor chains, developed a computational framework to predict receptor pairs, and linked the expansion of distinct B cell clones to different tumor-associated gene expression programs. Spatial VDJ delineates B cell clonal diversity and lineage trajectories within their anatomical niche. Thus, Spatial VDJ captures lymphocyte spatial clonal architecture across tissues, providing a platform to harness clonal sequences for therapy.},

StabMap first infers a mosaic data topology based on shared features, then projects all cells onto supervised or unsupervised reference coordinates by traversing shortest paths along the topology.

  abstract = {Accurately quantifying gene and isoform expression changes is essential to understanding cell functions, differentiation and disease. Sequencing full-length native RNAs using long-read direct RNA sequencing (DRS) has the potential to overcome many limitations of short and long-read sequencing methods that require RNA fragmentation, cDNA synthesis or PCR. However, there are a lack of tools specifically designed for DRS and its ability to identify differential expression in complex organisms is poorly characterised. We developed NanoCount for fast, accurate transcript isoform quantification in DRS and demonstrate it outperforms similar methods. Using synthetic controls and human SH-SY5Y cell differentiation into neuron-like cells, we show that DRS accurately quantifies RNA expression and identifies differential expression of genes and isoforms. Differential expression of 231 genes, 333 isoforms, plus 27 isoform switches were detected between undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and samples clustered by differentiation state at the gene and isoform level. Genes upregulated in neuron-like cells were associated with neurogenesis. NanoCount quantification of thousands of novel isoforms discovered with DRS likewise enabled identification of their differential expression. Our results demonstrate enhanced DRS isoform quantification with NanoCount and establish the ability of DRS to identify biologically relevant differential expression of genes and isoforms.},

Here we introduce Smart-seq3, which combines full-length transcriptome coverage with a 5′ unique molecular identifier RNA counting strategy that enables in silico reconstruction of thousands of RNA molecules per cell. Of the counted and reconstructed molecules, 60\% could be directly assigned to allelic origin and 30–50\% to specific isoforms, and we identified substantial differences in isoform usage in different mouse strains and human cell types. Smart-seq3 greatly increased sensitivity compared to Smart-seq2, typically detecting thousands more transcripts per cell. We expect that Smart-seq3 will enable large-scale characterization of cell types and states across tissues and organisms.},

PCR followed by MiSeq sequencing showed that at least 84.1\% of these predicted novel splice sites could be valiyeard. In contrast to known transcripts, the expression of these novel transcripts were highly tissue-specific. Based on these novel transcripts, at least 36 novel proteins were detected from shotgun proteomics data of 41 breast samples. We also showed L1 retrotransposons have a more significant impact on the origin of new transcripts/genes than previously thought. Furthermore, we found that alternative splicing is extraordinarily widespread for genes involved in specific biological functions like protein binding, nucleoside binding, neuron projection, membrane organization and cell adhesion. In the end, the total number of human transcripts with protein-coding potential was estimated to be at least 204,950.},

  abstract = {Traditional epitranscriptomics relies on capturing a single RNA modification by antibody or chemical treatment, combined with short-read sequencing to identify its transcriptomic location. This approach is labor-intensive and may introduce experimental artifacts. Direct sequencing of native RNA using Oxford Nanopore Technologies~(ONT) can allow for directly detecting the RNA base modifications, although these modifications might appear as sequencing errors. The percent Error of Specific Bases (\%ESB) was higher for native RNA than unmodified RNA, which enabled the detection of ribonucleotide modification sites. Based on the \%ESB differences, we developed a bioinformatic tool, epitranscriptional landscape inferring from glitches of ONT signals (ELIGOS), that is based on various types of synthetic modified RNA and applied to rRNA and mRNA. ELIGOS is able to accurately predict known classes of RNA methylation sites (AUC \&gt; 0.93) in rRNAs from Escherichiacoli, yeast, and human cells, using either unmodified in vitro transcription RNA or a background error model, which mimics the systematic error of direct RNA sequencing as the reference. The well-known DRACH/RRACH motif was localized and identified, consistent with previous studies, using differential analysis of ELIGOS to study the impact of RNA m6A methyltransferase by comparing wild type and knockouts in yeast and mouse cells. Lastly, the DRACH motif could also be identified in the mRNA of three human cell lines. The mRNA modification identified by ELIGOS is at the level of individual base resolution. In summary, we have developed a bioinformatic software package to uncover native RNA modifications.}

  abstract = {Motivation Long read sequencing technology is becoming an increasingly indispensable tool in genomic and transcriptomic analysis. In transcriptomics in particular, long reads offer the possibility of sequencing full-length isoforms, which can vastly simplify the identification of novel transcripts and transcript quantification. However, despite this promise, the focus of much long read method development to year has been on transcript identification, with comparatively little attention paid to quantification. Yet, due to differences in the underlying protocols and technologies, lower throughput (i.e. fewer reads sequenced per sample compared to short read technologies), as well as technical artifacts, long read quantification remains a challenge, motivating the continued development and assessment of quantification methods tailored to this increasingly prevalent type of data. Results We introduce a new method and software tool for long read transcript quantification called oarfish. Our model incorporates a novel and innovative coverage score, which affects the conditional probability of fragment assignment in the underlying probabilistic model. We demonstrate that by accounting for this coverage information, oarfish is able to produce more accurate quantification estimates than existing long read quantification methods, particularly when one considers the primary isoforms present in a particular cell line or tissue type. Availability and Implementation Oarfish is implemented in the Rust programming language, and is made available as free and open-source software under the BSD 3-clause license.

The advent of third generation sequencing technologies providing significantly longer reads opens up new possibilities. However, the high error rates common to these technologies set new bioinformatics challenges for the gapped alignment of reads to their genomic origin. In this study, we have explored how currently available RNA-seq splice-aware alignment tools cope with increased read lengths and error rates. All tested tools were initially developed for short NGS reads, but some have claimed support for long Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or even Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION reads.The tools were tested on synthetic and real datasets from two technologies (PacBio and ONT MinION). Alignment quality and resource usage were compared across different aligners. The effect of error correction of long reads was explored, both using self-correction and correction with an external short reads dataset. A tool was developed for evaluating RNA-seq alignment results. This tool can be used to compare the alignment of simulated reads to their genomic origin, or to compare the alignment of real reads to a set of annotated transcripts. Our tests show that while some RNA-seq aligners were unable to cope with long error-prone reads, others produced overall good results. We further show that alignment accuracy can be improved using error-corrected reads.https://github.com/kkrizanovic/RNAseqEval, https://figshare.com/projects/RNAseq\_benchmark/24391Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

For RNA-sequencing, there are several established software packages for this purpose accompanied with analysis pipelines that are well described. However, there are two crucial steps in the analysis process that can be a stumbling block for many -- the set up an appropriate model via design matrices and the set up of comparisons of interest via contrast matrices. These steps are particularly troublesome because an extensive catalogue for design and contrast matrices does not currently exist. One would usually search for example case studies across different platforms and mix and match the advice from those sources to suit the dataset they have at hand. This article guides the reader through the basics of how to set up design and contrast matrices. We take a practical approach by providing code and graphical representation of each case study, starting with simpler examples (e.g. models with a single explanatory variable) and move onto more complex ones (e.g. interaction models, mixed effects models, higher order time series and cyclical models). Although our work has been written specifically with a limma -style pipeline in mind, most of it is also applicable to other software packages for differential expression analysis, and the ideas covered can be adapted to data analysis of other high-throughput technologies. Where appropriate, we explain the interpretation and differences between models to aid readers in their own model choices. Unnecessary jargon and theory is omitted where possible so that our work is accessible to a wide audience of readers, from beginners to those with experience in genomics data analysis.},

This suggests that repeated infection qualitatively changes CD4+ T cells, although the heterogeneity and dynamics of these responses await systematic analysis in vivo. Here, we examined TCR transgenic PbTII and polyclonal CD4+ T cells during Plasmodium re-infection in mice, in conjunction with scRNA-seq/TCR-seq and spatial transcriptomics at near single-cell resolution. PbTII cells gave rise to multiple antigen-experienced states in different areas of the spleen after primary infection and antimalarial treatment, including ongoing GC responses and T-cell zone memory. Upon re-infection, Th1-memory PbTII cells initiated a rapid effector response prior to proliferating, while GC Tfh cells of the same antigen specificity were entirely refractory within the same organ. Transcriptome dynamic modelling and network analysis of Th1 recall revealed a biphasic wave of RNA processing that firstly preceded immune effector transcription, and later accompanied cellular proliferation. Importantly, Th1 recall constituted a partial facsimile of primary Th1 responses, with no unique genes amongst the small subset of those upregulated upon re-infection. Finally, we noted a similar spectrum of antigen-experienced states and recall dynamics by polyclonal CD4+ T cells with diverse TCRs. Therefore, during re-infection with Plasmodium, persisting GC Tfh cells remained unaltered transcriptionally, Tcm/Tfh-like cells exhibited minimal proliferation, and Th1-memory cells displayed a rapid, proliferating IL-10-producing Tr1 response consistent with a shift towards immune-regulation. These data highlight a broad spectrum of simultaneous CD4+ T cell responses that occur in the spleen during re-infection with malaria parasites. HighlightsSplenic TCR transgenic CD4+ T cells are highly heterogeneous prior to re-infection.Persisting GC Tfh cells are refractory to re-activation during re-infection.Th1-memory cells rapidly upregulate RNA processing prior to effector function and proliferation.Th1-recall is an imperfect but faithful facsimile of primary Th1 responses.A spectrum of recall states is observed in polyclonal CD4+ T cells with diverse TCRs.},

Rsubread is based on the successful Subread suite with the added ease-of-use of the R programming environment, creating a matrix of read counts directly as an R object ready for downstream analysis. It integrates read mapping and quantification in a single package and has no software dependencies other than R itself. We demonstrate Rsubread’s ability to detect exon–exon junctions de novo and to quantify expression at the level of either genes, exons or exon junctions. The resulting read counts can be input directly into a wide range of downstream statistical analyses using other Bioconductor packages. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq as well as to counting functions in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We consider the performance of these tools on the combined quantification task starting from raw sequence reads through to summary counts, and in particular evaluate the performance of different combinations of alignment and counting algorithms. We show that Rsubread is faster and uses less memory than competitor tools and produces read count summaries that more accurately correlate with true values.}

However, to year, no independent studies have comparatively analyzed these integration methods to benchmark their performance. Here we present benchmarking of 16 integration methods using 45 paired datasets (comprising both spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data) and 32 simulated datasets. We found that Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methods for predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, whereas Cell2location, SpatialDWLS, and RCTD are the top-performing methods for the cell type deconvolution of spots.

In this study, we show that, as expected, there is a strong positive correlation between gene length, transcript length, and protein size as well as a correlation with the number of genetic variants and introns. Among tissue-specific genes, we find that the longest transcripts tend to be expressed in the blood vessels, nerves, thyroid, cervix uteri, and the brain, while the smallest transcripts tend to be expressed in the pancreas, skin, stomach, vagina, and testis. We report, as shown previously, that natural selection suppresses changes for genes with longer transcripts and promotes changes for genes with smaller transcripts. We also observe that genes with longer transcripts tend to have a higher number of co-expressed genes and protein-protein interactions, as well as more associated publications. In the functional analysis, we show that bigger transcripts are often associated with neuronal development, while smaller transcripts tend to play roles in skin development and in the immune system. Furthermore, pathways related to cancer, neurons, and heart diseases tend to have genes with longer transcripts, with smaller transcripts being present in pathways related to immune responses and neurodegenerative diseases. Based on our results, we hypothesize that longer genes tend to be associated with functions that are important in the early development stages, while smaller genes tend to play a role in functions that are important throughout the whole life, like the immune system, which requires fast responses.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells.

  abstract = {Alternative splicing allows individual genes to generate multiple mRNAs. Many of these mRNAs encode functionally distinct protein isoforms, thereby bridging the gap between genome and proteome.Alternative splicing mechanisms have traditionally been investigated using individual model systems, but these approaches are now being complemented by global analyses. The regulation of splicing commonly involves the modulation of early steps in spliceosome assembly. The cis elements comprise splicing enhancers and silencers that can be located in either the exons or the introns and that bind activator and repressor proteins.Sometimes, the presence or absence of a single regulator is sufficient to determine alternative splicing pathways. More commonly, combinations of more widespread factors are involved in the choice of splicing pathway. This gives rise to the concept of 'cellular codes', which are constituted by particular combinations of regulatory factors.Members of the SR protein family can activate splicing by binding to exon splicing enhancers (ESEs). Models for the action of enhancers include the recruitment of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) to weak 3′ splice sites, the interaction with co-activators and direct contact with the RNA at the branch point.Repressors, which are frequently members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, function by making splice sites inaccessible or by promoting the formation of 'dead-end' splicing related complexes. Alternative splicing decisions frequently involve the dynamic antagonism between regulatory activators and repressors.Several global strategies for identifying splicing silencers and enhancers have been successfully deployed. These include RNA-binding SELEX studies, functional SELEX in vitro, cell-based selection assays and computational surveys for the differential enrichment of sequence motifs in expected locations for silencers and enhancers.Methods are being developed to detect complete sets of cellular RNAs with which individual splicing regulators interact. These include assays that detect RNAs to which the factor binds, or alternative splicing events that are affected by depletion of the regulator. A key technical development is the recent introduction of alternative splicing microarrays, which allow parallel analysis of large numbers of alternative splicing events and should facilitate the deciphering of cellular codes.},

Given the subsequent tumour and inter-patient heterogeneity, drug-based treatments report limited success, calling for multi-omics studies to extract regulatory relationships, and ultimately, to develop targeted therapies. However, current methods are unable to extract nonlinear multi-omics perturbations. Here, we present SiRCle (Signature Regulatory Clustering), a novel method to integrate DNA methylation, RNA-seq and proteomics data. Applying SiRCle to a case study of ccRCC, we disentangle the layer (DNA methylation, transcription and/or translation) where dys-regulation first occurs and find the primary biological processes altered. Next, we detect regulatory differences between patient subsets by using a variational autoencoder to integrate omics’ data followed by statistical comparisons on the integrated space. In ccRCC patients, SiRCle allows to identify metabolic enzymes and cell-type-specific markers associated with survival along with the likely molecular driver behind the gene’s perturbations.},

  abstract = {The approximate string matching problem is to find all locations at which a query of lengthm matches a substring of a text of length n with k-or-fewer differences. Simple and practical bit-vector algorithms have been designed for this problem, most notably the one used in agrep. These algorithms compute a bit representation of the current state-set of the k-difference automaton for the query, and asymptotically run in either O(nm/w) or O(nm log σ/w) time where w is the word size of the machine (e.g., 32 or 64 in practice), and σ is the size of the pattern alphabet. Here we present an algorithm of comparable simplicity that requires only O(nm/w) time by virtue of computing a bit representation of the relocatable dynamic programming matrix for the problem. Thus, the algorithm's performance is independent of k, and it is found to be more efficient than the previous results for many choices of k and smallm. Moreover, because the algorithm is not dependent on k, it can be used to rapidly compute blocks of the dynamic programming matrix as in the 4-Russians algorithm of Wu et al.(1996). This gives rise to an O(kn/w) expected-time algorithm for the case where m may be arbitrarily large. In practice this new algorithm, that computes a region of the dynamic progr amming (d.p.) matrx w entries at a time using the basic algorithm as a subroutine is significantly faster than our previous 4-Russians algorithm, that computes the same region 4 or 5 entries at a time using table lookup. This performance improvement yields a code that is either superior or competitive with all existing algorithms except for some filtration algorithms that are superior when k/m is sufficiently small.},

  abstract = {Human brain development is under tight molecular genetic control and the recent advent of single-cell genomics has revolutionized our ability to eluciyear the diverse underlying cell-types and states. Although RNA splicing is highly prevalent in the brain and has strong links to neuropsychiatric disorders, previous work has not systematically investigated the role of cell-type-specific splicing or transcript-isoform diversity during human brain development. Here, we leverage single molecule long-read sequencing to deeply profile the full-length transcriptome of the germinal zone (GZ) and cortical plate (CP) regions of the developing human neocortex at tissue and single-cell resolution. We identify 214,516 unique isoforms, corresponding to 22,391 genes. Remarkably, we find that 72.6\% of these are novel and together with {$>$}7,000 novel-spliced exons expands the proteome by 92,422 proteoforms. We uncover myriad novel isoform switches during cortical neurogenesis, implicating previously-uncharacterized RNA-binding protein-mediated and other regulatory mechanisms in cellular identity and disease. Early-stage excitatory neurons exhibit the greatest isoform diversity and isoform-based single-cell clustering identifies previously uncharacterized cell states. Leveraging this resource, we re-prioritize thousands of rare de novo risk variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and reveal that risk genes are strongly associated with the number of unique isoforms observed per gene. Altogether, this work uncovers a substantial contribution of transcript-isoform diversity in cellular identity in the developing neocortex, eluciyears novel genetic risk mechanisms for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, and provides a comprehensive isoform-centric gene annotation for the developing human brain.

Despite unbiased in-depth analysis, the low sequencing throughput often results in insufficient read coverage thereby limiting our ability to perform mutation calling for specific genes. Here, we developed a single-cell Rapid Capture Hybridization sequencing (scRaCH-seq) method that demonstrated high specificity and efficiency in capturing targeted transcripts using long-read sequencing, allowing an in-depth analysis of mutation status and transcript usage for genes of interest. The method includes creating a probe panel for transcript capture, using barcoded primers for pooling and efficient sequencing via Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. scRaCH-seq is applicable to stored and indexed single-cell cDNA which allows analysis to be combined with existing short-read RNA-seq datasets. In our investigation of BTK and SF3B1 genes in samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), we detected SF3B1 isoforms and mutations with high sensitivity. Integration with short-read scRNA-seq data revealed significant gene expression differences in SF3B1-mutated CLL cells, though it did not impact the sensitivity of the anti-cancer drug venetoclax. scRaCH-seq’s capability to study long-read transcripts of multiple genes makes it a powerful tool for single-cell genomics.},

This has led to the introduction of gene set analysis (GSA) methods that aim at identifying interpretable global effects by grouping genes into sets of common context, such as, molecular pathways, biological function or tissue localization. In practice, GSA often results in hundreds of differentially regulated gene sets. Similar to the genes they contain, gene sets are often regulated in a correlative fashion because they share many of their genes or they describe related processes. Using these kind of neighborhood information to construct networks of gene sets allows to identify highly connected sub-networks as well as poorly connected islands or singletons. We show here how topological information and other network features can be used to filter and prioritize gene sets in routine DGE studies. Community detection in combination with automatic labeling and the network representation of gene set clusters further constitute an appealing and intuitive visualization of GSA results. The RICHNET workflow described here does not require human intervention and can thus be conveniently incorporated in automated analysis pipelines.},

Our data revealed that strong ligands drove more efficient and uniform activation than did weak ligands, but all activated cells were fully cytolytic. Notably, activation followed the same transcriptional pathways regardless of ligand potency. Thus, stimulation strength did not intrinsically dictate the T cell–activation route or phenotype; instead, it controlled how rapidly and simultaneously the cells initiated activation, allowing limited machinery to elicit wide-ranging responses.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

Historically, each type of data was analysed separately, although approaches to integrate omic data sets to predict complex phenotypic traits are now emerging.Such systems genomics approaches to combine multiple data types provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex genotype–phenotype associations than analysis of one data set.Data from multiple sources that point to the association of the same gene or pathway are less likely to result in false positives.There are various strengths and weaknesses of the available strategies. The approach used needs to be selected according to specific types of data, different types of scientific questions or different types of underlying genomic models.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).Contact: ~mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

This raw current signal data can be ‘basecalled’ into sequence information and has the potential to identify other diverse molecular features, such as base modifications, secondary structures, etc. Despite the unique properties and potential utility of nanopore signal data, there are currently limited options available for signal data visualisation. To address this, we have developed Squigualiser, a toolkit for intuitive, interactive visualisation of sequence-aligned signal data, which currently supports both DNA and RNA sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) instruments. A series of methodological innovations enable efficient alignment of raw signal data to a reference genome/transcriptome with single-base resolution. Squigualiser generates an interactive signal browser view (HTML file), in which the user can navigate across a genome/transcriptome region and customise the display. Multiple independent reads are integrated into a signal ‘pileup’ format and different datasets can be displayed as parallel tracks to facilitate their comparison. Squigualiser provides the most sophisticated framework for nanopore signal data visualisation to year and will catalyse new advances in signal analysis.

It achieves this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering of noise, a robust resolution of alternative splicing events and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies. It was tested on human and mouse RNA-seq data and is shown to improve significantly on the transABySS and Trinity de novo transcriptome assemblers.Availability and implementation: Oases is freely available under the GPL license at www.ebi.ac.uk/\textasciitilde zerbino/oases/Contact:dzerbino@ucsc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

This has helped immunologists to increase their understanding of heterogeneity, complexity, and lineage relationships of white blood cells. Current statistical methods often collapse the rich single-cell data into summary statistics before proceeding with downstream analysis, discarding the information in these multivariate datasets. In this article, our aim is to exhibit the use of statistical analyses on the raw, uncompressed data thus improving replicability, and exposing multivariate patterns and their associated uncertainty profiles. We show that multivariate generative models are a valid alternative to univariate hypothesis testing. We propose two models: a multivariate Poisson log-normal mixed model and a logistic linear mixed model. We show that these models are complementary and that either model can account for different confounders. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to provide Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our models applied to a recent pregnancy study successfully reproduce key findings while quantifying increased overall protein-to-protein correlations between first and third trimester.},

Standalone, scNanoGPS deconvolutes error-prone long-reads into single-cells and single-molecules, and simultaneously accesses both phenotypes and genotypes of individual cells.

In a kidney tumor, we identify 924 DCI genes involved in cell-type-specific functions such as PDE10A in tumor cells and CCL3 in lymphocytes. Transcriptome-wide mutation analyses identify many cell-type-specific mutations including VEGFA mutations in tumor cells and HLA-A mutations in immune cells, highlighting the~critical roles of different mutant populations in tumors.

Through a UMI, identical copies arising from distinct molecules can be distinguished from those arising through PCR-amplification of the same molecule.

In particular, sequencing errors in the UMI sequence are often ignored, or else resolved in an ad-hoc manner. We show that errors in the UMI sequence are common and introduce network based methods to account for these errors when identifying PCR duplicates. Using these methods, we demonstrate improved quantification accuracy both under simulated conditions and real iCLIP and single cell RNA-Seq datasets. Reproducibility between iCLIP replicates and single cell RNA Seq clustering are both improved using our proposed network-based method, demonstrating the value of properly accounting for errors in UMIs.

Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommoyear tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

While many statistical methods are available to identify differentially expressed genes, the principles that distinguish these methods and their performance remain unclear. Here, we show that the relative performance of these methods is contingent on their ability to account for variation between biological replicates. Methods that ignore this inevitable variation are biased and prone to false discoveries. Indeed, the most widely used methods can discover hundreds of differentially expressed genes in the absence of biological differences. Our results suggest an urgent need for a paradigm shift in the methods used to perform differential expression analysis in single-cell data.},

After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize \emph{in situ} gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns.

The application of this software to female mouse placenta and neural stem cell samples enabled the study of methylation patterns in the context of X-inactivation. Additionally, the proliferation of single-cell analysis techniques and the need for comprehensive pipeline-level benchmarking led me to create the CellBench package, which can automatically execute complete combinations of methods to fully characterise the performance of single-cell analysis pipelines. This package establishes a benchmarking framework for combinations of methods that promotes modular code without duplication, resulting in readable, reproducible, and extensible pipeline benchmarking code. Both packages are open source and available through the R/Bioconductor repository, providing useful support for researchers who are working with these emerging and quickly advancing genomic technologies.},

To facilitate discovery with published single-cell transcriptomics data, we have assembled a near exhaustive, manually curated database of single-cell transcriptomics studies with key information: descriptions of the type of data and technologies used, along with descriptors of the biological systems studied. Additionally, the database contains summarized information about analysis in the papers, allowing for analysis of trends in the field.

  abstract = {Background RNA-Seq has brought forth significant discoveries regarding aberrations in RNA processing, implicating these RNA variants in a variety of diseases. Aberrant splicing and single nucleotide variants in RNA have been demonstrated to alter transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, the upregulation of ADAR, an enzyme which mediates adenosine-to-inosine editing, has been previously linked to an increase in the invasiveness of lung ADC cells and associated with splicing regulation. Despite the functional importance of studying splicing and SNVs, short read RNA-Seq has limited the community’s ability to interrogate both forms of RNA variation simultaneously. Results We employed long-read technology to obtain full-length transcript sequences, elucidating cis-effects of variants on splicing changes at a single molecule level. We have developed a computational workflow that augments FLAIR, a tool that calls isoform models expressed in long-read data, to integrate RNA variant calls with the associated isoforms that bear them. We generated nanopore data with high sequence accuracy of H1975 lung adenocarcinoma cells with and without knockdown of ADAR. We applied our workflow to identify key inosine-isoform associations to help clarify the prominence of ADAR in tumorigenesis. Conclusions Ultimately, we find that a long-read approach provides valuable insight toward characterizing the relationship between RNA variants and splicing patterns. HighlightsFLAIR2 has improved transcript isoform detection and incorporates sequence variants for haplotype-specific transcript detection.In addition to haplotype-specific variant detection, it identifies transcript-specific RNA editingAble to identify haplotype-specific transcript isoform bias in expressionLong-read sequencing identifies hyperedited transcripts that are missed from short-read sequencing methods for a more comprehensive identification of ADAR targets},

The advances in sequencing technology have created a need for studies and tools that can characterize these novel variants. Here, we present SQANTI, an automated pipeline for the classification of long-read transcripts that can assess the quality of data and the preprocessing pipeline using 47 unique descriptors. We apply SQANTI to a neuronal mouse transcriptome using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long reads and illustrate how the tool is effective in characterizing and describing the composition of the full-length transcriptome. We perform extensive evaluation of ToFU PacBio transcripts by PCR to reveal that an important number of the novel transcripts are technical artifacts of the sequencing approach and that SQANTI quality descriptors can be used to engineer a filtering strategy to remove them. Most novel transcripts in this curated transcriptome are novel combinations of existing splice sites, resulting more frequently in novel ORFs than novel UTRs, and are enriched in both general metabolic and neural-specific functions. We show that these new transcripts have a major impact in the correct quantification of transcript levels by state-of-the-art short-read-based quantification algorithms. By comparing our iso-transcriptome with public proteomics databases, we find that alternative isoforms are elusive to proteogenomics detection. SQANTI allows the user to maximize the analytical outcome of long-read technologies by providing the tools to deliver quality-evaluated and curated full-length transcriptomes.},

Results from scPipe can be used as input for downstream analyses and can be easily incorporated into R-based pipelines with other tools.

Multiple datasets were generated using both droplet and plate-based scRNAseq protocols and processed by scPipe. We found pipelines suited to different types of data for different tasks. Our data and analysis provide a comprehensive framework for benchmarking most common scRNA-seq analysis steps. Finally, I developed single cell full-length transcript sequencing by sampling (FLT-seq), together with the computational pipeline FLAMES to perform isoform discovery and quantification, splicing analysis and mutation detection in single cells.

We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates.

  abstract = {High-throughput short-read sequencing has revolutionized how transcriptomes are quantified and annotated. However, while Illumina short-read sequencers can be used to analyze entire transcriptomes down to the level of individual splicing events with great accuracy, they fall short of analyzing how these individual events are combined into complete RNA transcript isoforms. Because of this shortfall, long-distance information is required to complement short-read sequencing to analyze transcriptomes on the level of full-length RNA transcript isoforms. While long-read sequencing technology can provide this long-distance information, there are issues with both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing technologies that prevent their widespread adoption. Briefly, PacBio sequencers produce low numbers of reads with high accuracy, while ONT sequencers produce higher numbers of reads with lower accuracy. Here, we introduce and valiyear a long-read ONT-based sequencing method. At the same cost, our Rolling Circle Amplification to Concatemeric Consensus (R2C2) method generates more accurate reads of full-length RNA transcript isoforms than any other available long-read sequencing method. These reads can then be used to generate isoform-level transcriptomes for both genome annotation and differential expression analysis in bulk or single-cell samples.},

  abstract = {Cis-acting elements within exons and introns make up a splicing code that is required for efficient pre-mRNA splicing. A large fraction of non-synonymous exonic mutations cause disease due to disrupted splicing rather than the predicted amino-acid change.Splicing affects disease by three general mechanisms: as a direct cause, as a modifier of severity and as a determinant of disease susceptibility. In all three cases, the pathogenic splicing effect can be in cis affecting the 'disease gene' or in trans resulting from alterations of the splicing environment.Genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing using splicing microarrays has identified coordinated networks of splicing regulation. Computational analysis of co-regulated exons has identified motifs of known RNA binding proteins as well as novel motifs.Pathogenesis of a growing number of microsatellite expansion disorders is known to involve the expression of repeat-containing RNAs that have a toxic effect by disrupting regulators of alternative splicing.Analysis of 50 cancer-relevant genes that are thought to be well characterized has found that two-thirds of these genes express novel isoforms in normal tissues, and that the novel isoform is predominant for 40\% of these genes. This finding illustrates the need to identify predominant splice variants for the cells and tissues of interest.The oncogenic activities of two genes are enhanced by the splicing factor SF2/ASF through induction of oncogenic alternatively spliced isoforms.Splicing-based therapeutic approaches are directed at either reversing or circumventing the deleterious splicing pattern.},

  abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is one crucial step of gene expression that must be tightly regulated during neurodevelopment. However, the precise timing of developmental splicing switches and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we systematically analyze the temporal regulation of AS in a large number of transcriptome profiles of developing mouse cortices, in vivo purified neuronal subtypes, and neurons differentiated in vitro. Our analysis reveals early-switch and late-switch exons in genes with distinct functions, and these switches accurately define neuronal maturation stages. Integrative modeling suggests that these switches are under direct and combinatorial regulation by distinct sets of neuronal RNA-binding proteins including Nova, Rbfox, Mbnl, and Ptbp. Surprisingly, various neuronal subtypes in the sensory systems lack Nova and/or Rbfox expression. These neurons retain the “immature” splicing program in early-switch exons, affecting numerous synaptic genes. These results provide new insights into the organization and regulation of the neurodevelopmental transcriptome.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

  abstract = {CD4+ T cells orchestrate adaptive immunity to circulating malaria parasites; yet cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms controlling Th1 and Tfh differentiation in the spleen remain to be fully defined in vivo. Here, using a murine model of CD4-dependent immunity, we tested if Slide-seqV2, a spatial transcriptomic method with near single-cell resolution, could determine the locations of multiple CD4+ T cell subsets and potentially interacting cellular partners in the spleen during infection. Firstly, Slide-seqV2 readily mapped splenic cellular structure and microanatomical change during infection. Next, computational integration with scRNA-seq reference datasets of splenocytes, stromal cells, and specifically of polyclonal CD4+ T cells and B cells, mapped the relative locations of multiple cell-types within this dense tissue. scRNA-seq of B cells over time mapped emergence of germinal centre B cells, red pulp-located plasmablasts and atypical B cells, and uncovered a prolonged CD4+ T-cell-independent, follicular bystander B cell response marked by Sca-1 and Ly6C upregulation. scRNA-seq of activated, polyclonal CD4+ T cells revealed their similarity to our previous TCR transgenic models. Importantly, spatial analysis revealed polyclonal Th1 cells co-localised with CXCL9/10-producing monocytes in the red pulp, while polyclonal Tfh-like cells were located close to CXCL13-expressing B cell follicles, consistent with our previous CXCR3/CXCR5 competition model of Th1/Tfh bifurcation. CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of either or both CXCR3 and CXCR5 in naïve Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cells had unexpectedly minor effects on Th1 differentiation in vivo. Instead, CXCR5 was essential for maximising clonal expansion, suggesting a role for splenic CXCL13+ cells in supporting CD4+ T cell proliferation in malaria. Thus, spatial transcriptomics at near single-cell resolution was feasible in densely packed secondary lymphoid tissue, providing multiple insights into mechanisms controlling splenic polyclonal CD4+ T cell and B cell differentiation during infection. HighlightsSlide-seqV2 maps splenic microanatomy, including stromal and immune cell location.Bystander activation of all follicular B cells occurs in malaria, marked by Sca-1/Ly6C upregulation.Single naïve polyclonal CD4+ T cells differentiate mostly into Th1 and Tfh cells in malaria.Cell-cell colocalization analysis positions Th1 cells with monocytes in red pulp, and Tfh cells with Cxcl13+ B cell follicles.CXCR5, but not CXCR3, supports parasite-specific CD4+ T cell clonal expansion.},

  abstract = {Motivation: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group.Results: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems.Availability: ROAST is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.orgContact: ~smyth@wehi.edu.auSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

While cost-effective and accurate for quantification, short-read RNA-seq lacks the ability to resolve full-length transcript isoforms despite increasingly sophisticated computational methods. Long-read sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) bypass the transcript reconstruction challenges of short reads. Here we introduce TALON, the ENCODE4 pipeline for platform-independent analysis of long-read transcriptomes. We apply TALON to the GM12878 cell line and show that while both PacBio and ONT technologies perform well at full-transcript discovery and quantification, each displayed distinct technical artifacts. We further apply TALON to mouse hippocampus and cortex transcriptomes and find that 422 genes found in these regions have more reads associated with novel isoforms than with annotated ones. We demonstrate that TALON is a capable of tracking both known and novel transcript models as well as their expression levels across datasets for both simple studies and in larger projects. These properties will enable TALON users to move beyond the limitations of short-read data to perform isoform discovery and quantification in a uniform manner on existing and future long-read platforms.},

With the recent introduction of R10 flowcells by Oxford Nanopore, we propose that previous computational methods designed to handle high sequencing error rates are no longer relevant, and that the prevailing approach using short reads to compile "barcode space" (candiyear barcode list) to de-multiplex long reads are no longer necessary. Instead, computational methods should now shift focus on harnessing the unique benefits of long reads to analyze transcriptome complexity. In this context, we introduce a comprehensive suite of computational methods named Single-Cell Omics for Transcriptome CHaracterization (SCOTCH). Our method is compatible with the single-cell library preparation platform from both 10X Genomics and Parse Biosciences, facilitating the analysis of special cell populations, such as neurons, hepatocytes and developing cardiomyocytes. We specifically re-formulated the transcript mapping problem with a compatibility matrix and addressed the multiple-mapping issue using probabilistic inference, which allows the discovery of novel isoforms as well as the detection of differential isoform usage between cell populations. We evaluated SCOTCH through analysis of real data across different combinations of single-cell libraries and sequencing technologies (10X + Illumina, Parse + Illumina, 10X + Nanopore\_R9, 10X + Nanopore\_R10, Parse + Nanopore\_R10), and showed its ability to infer novel biological insights on cell type-specific isoform expression. These datasets enhance the availability of publicly available data for continued development of computational approaches. In summary, SCOTCH allows extraction of more biological insights from the new advancements in single-cell library construction and sequencing technologies, facilitating the examination of transcriptome complexity at the single-cell level.},

However, short-read (SR) scRNAseq methodologies such as 10x are restricted to sequencing the 3’ or 5’ ends of transcripts, providing accurate gene expression but little information on the RNA isoforms expressed in each cell. Newly developed long-read (LR) scRNA-seq enables the quantification of RNA isoforms in individual cells but LR scRNA-seq using the Oxford Nanopore platform has largely relied upon matched short-read data to identify cell barcodes and allow single cell analysis. Here we introduce BLAZE (Barcode identification from long-reads for AnalyZing single-cell gene Expression), which accurately and efficiently identifies 10x cell barcodes using only nanopore LR scRNA-seq data. We compared BLAZE to existing tools, including cell barcodes identified from matched SR scRNA-seq, on differentiating stem cells and 5 cancer cell lines. BLAZE outperforms existing tools and provides a more accurate representation of the cells present in LR scRNA-seq than using matched short-reads. BLAZE provides accurate cell barcodes over a wide range of experimental read depths and sequencing accuracies, while other methodologies commonly identify false-positive barcodes and cell clusters, disrupting biological interpretation of LR scRNA-seq results. In conclusion, BLAZE eliminates the requirement for matched SR scRNA-seq to interpret LR scRNA-seq, simplifying procedures and decreasing costs while also improving LR scRNA-seq results.

  abstract = {Motivation Long read sequencing methods have considerable advantages for characterising RNA isoforms. Oxford nanopore sequencing records changes in electrical current when nucleic acid traverses through a pore. However, basecalling of this raw signal (known as a squiggle) is error prone, making it challenging to accurately identify splice junctions. Existing strategies include utilising matched short-read data and/or annotated splice junctions to correct nanopore reads but add expense or limit junctions to known (incomplete) annotations. Therefore, a method that could accurately identify splice junctions solely from nanopore data would have numerous advantages. Results We developed “NanoSplicer” to identify splice junctions using raw nanopore signal (squiggles). For each splice junction the observed squiggle is compared to candiyear squiggles representing potential junctions to identify the correct candiyear. Measuring squiggle similarity enables us to compute the probability of each candiyear junction and find the most likely one. We tested our method using 1. synthetic mRNAs with known splice junctions 2. biological mRNAs from a lung-cancer cell-line. The results from both datasets demonstrate NanoSplicer improves splice junction identification, especially when the basecalling error rate near the splice junction is elevated. Our method is implemented in the software package NanoSplicer, available at https://github.com/shimlab/NanoSplicer.},

  abstract = {As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records the growth of the field over time.},

  abstract = {The treatment landscape of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is evolving, with promising therapies entering clinical translation, yet patient responses remain heterogeneous, and biomarkers for tailoring treatment are lacking. To understand how disease heterogeneity links with therapy response, we determined the leukemia cell hierarchy makeup from bulk transcriptomes of more than 1,000 patients through deconvolution using single-cell reference profiles of leukemia stem, progenitor and mature cell types. Leukemia hierarchy composition was associated with functional, genomic and clinical properties and converged into four overall classes, spanning Primitive, Mature, GMP and Intermediate. Critically, variation in hierarchy composition along the Primitive versus GMP or Primitive versus Mature axes were associated with response to chemotherapy or drug sensitivity profiles of targeted therapies, respectively. A seven-gene biomarker derived from the Primitive versus Mature axis was associated with response to 105 investigational drugs. Cellular hierarchy composition constitutes a novel framework for understanding disease biology and advancing precision medicine in AML.},

  abstract = {Cells from the same individual share common genetic and environmental backgrounds and are not statistically independent; therefore, they are subsamples or pseudoreplicates. Thus, single-cell data have a hierarchical structure that many current single-cell methods do not address, leading to biased inference, highly inflated type 1 error rates, and reduced robustness and reproducibility. This includes methods that use a batch effect correction for individual as a means of accounting for within-sample correlation. Here, we document this dependence across a range of cell types and show that pseudo-bulk aggregation methods are conservative and underpowered relative to mixed models. To compute differential expression within a specific cell type across treatment groups, we propose applying generalized linear mixed models with a random effect for individual, to properly account for both zero inflation and the correlation structure among measures from cells within an individual. Finally, we provide power estimates across a range of experimental conditions to assist researchers in designing appropriately powered studies.},
